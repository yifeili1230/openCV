# Squat Analytics Guide

This guide describes the deterministic side-view squat analyzer, its real-time display,
configuration, data flow, and JSON session output.

## 1. Run Squat Analysis

From the project root:

```bash
./build/video_engine \
  --source video_source/IMG_1389.mov \
  --pipeline pose \
  --config configs/squat.yaml \
  --exercise squat
```

`configs/squat.yaml` already selects the pose pipeline and squat analyzer, so the shorter
equivalent is:

```bash
./build/video_engine \
  --source video_source/IMG_1389.mov \
  --config configs/squat.yaml
```

Press `ESC` in the video window to stop normally. `Ctrl+C` is also handled as a graceful
stop: the current inference finishes, the video writer is finalized, and the JSON summary
is written.

## 2. Runtime Data Flow

    +--> live metrics panel on the right
```

`SquatAnalyzer` implements `IPoseAnalyzer` and has no OpenCV dependency. The processor
adapts `FrameContext` to that pure interface. A future learned squat analyzer can
implement the same interface without changing video capture or pose inference.

## 3. Live Side Panel

The analyzer preserves the complete processed video and adds a 300-pixel panel to its
right. For a 640×480 processing frame, the displayed and saved result is 940×480.

The panel updates every processed frame:

- Current phase
- Completed repetition count
- Smoothed knee angle
- Hip angle, when the shoulder is valid
- Body-scale-normalized vertical hip speed
- Left or right observed body side
- Metrics for a newly completed repetition

When required joints have low confidence, the panel reports that the analysis state is
paused. A missing observation does not advance the phase or count a repetition.

## 4. Joint Selection and Measurements

The analyzer evaluates the left and right chains:

```text
shoulder -> hip -> knee -> ankle
```

It selects the side whose hip, knee, and ankle have the stronger minimum confidence.

The knee angle is:

```text
angle(hip, knee, ankle)
```

The hip angle is:

```text
angle(shoulder, hip, knee)
```

Angles are 2D image-plane projections. They are useful for a fixed side or approximately
45-degree view, but they are not anatomical 3D angles. The canonical pose schema already
reserves optional depth and 3D coordinates for a future calibrated implementation.

Vertical hip speed is calculated from source timestamps, not processing FPS:

```text
(current smoothed hip Y - previous smoothed hip Y)
--------------------------------------------------
     hip-to-knee body scale × source time delta
```

Positive values indicate downward image motion; negative values indicate upward motion.
The body-scale normalization makes the value less sensitive to image resolution and
distance from the camera. It is not meters per second.

## 5. Repetition State Machine

One repetition must pass through the complete ordered sequence:

```text
Standing -> Descending -> Bottom -> Ascending -> Standing
```

Default thresholds:

| Transition | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| Establish standing | Knee angle ≥ 160° |
| Start descending | Knee angle < 155° with downward motion or decreasing angle |
| Reach bottom | Knee angle ≤ 100° |
| Start ascending | Knee angle ≥ 105° with upward motion or increasing angle |
| Complete repetition | Knee angle ≥ 160° |

The separate entry and exit thresholds provide hysteresis so small fluctuations around a
single boundary do not repeatedly change the phase. A movement that never reaches the
bottom threshold is not counted.

## 6. Configuration

The settings live in `configs/squat.yaml`:

```yaml
exercise: squat
analysis_output_dir: output
squat:
  squat_standing_angle: 160
  squat_descent_start_angle: 155
  squat_bottom_angle: 100
  squat_bottom_exit_angle: 105
  squat_minimum_speed: 0.02
  squat_smoothing_alpha: 0.35
```

The pose confidence setting is also the minimum confidence used by the analyzer:

```yaml
pose_confidence: 0.12
```

Tune thresholds against representative videos. Camera placement, clothing, body
proportions, and model accuracy can all change the observed 2D angles.

## 7. Session Summary

The summary is written under `analysis_output_dir` using the input video's stem:

```text
video_source/IMG_1389.mov -> output/IMG_1389.json
video_source/squat.mov    -> output/squat.json
webcam                    -> output/webcam.json
```

The same path is replaced on the next run for that input. Example:

```json
{
  "source": "video_source/IMG_1389.mov",
  "exercise": "squat",
  "processed_frames": 875,
  "valid_analysis_frames": 851,
  "invalid_analysis_frames": 24,
  "total_reps": 1,
  "reps": [
    {
      "rep": 1,
      "start_time_seconds": 5.200,
      "end_time_seconds": 8.700,
      "descent_time_seconds": 1.700,
      "ascent_time_seconds": 1.800,
      "minimum_knee_angle_degrees": 91.400,
      "average_normalized_speed_per_second": 0.430,
      "peak_normalized_speed_per_second": 0.810
    }
  ]
}
```

The numbers above illustrate the schema and are not benchmark results.

## 8. Output Video

Video saving is independent from JSON summary saving:

```bash
./build/video_engine \
  --source video_source/IMG_1389.mov \
  --config configs/squat.yaml \
  --save output/IMG_1389_annotated
```

This produces a numbered MP4 such as:

```text
output/IMG_1389_annotated0.mp4
```

Use `--no-save` to skip annotated video encoding. The JSON summary is still written when
squat analysis is enabled.

## 9. Current Limitations

- The current OpenPose Caffe decoder emits one simple skeleton and is not a true
  multi-person decoder.
- Persistent primary-person tracking is not implemented yet.
- The analyzer can therefore follow incorrect joints if another person enters.
- Measurements are 2D projections and normalized image motion, not metric 3D motion.
- Thresholds have synthetic-sequence coverage but still require validation and tuning
  against a labeled real-video set.
- Current macOS CPU inference is much slower than the source video frame rate, although
  calculations still use source timestamps.

## 10. Tests

`tests/test_squat_analyzer.cpp` verifies:

- 2D angle calculation
- One complete phase cycle produces exactly one repetition
- Descent, ascent, minimum-angle, and speed metrics are populated
- Low-confidence observations do not corrupt state
- A shallow movement that never reaches the bottom is not counted
- Input video names map to the expected JSON summary path

Run:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
